| Nov 15 |   2:30pm-3pm    |                                                                                                    I began my first approach to the problem set. I decided that I wanted to try solving this problem set by representing each run of a given bit type (0 or 1) with an 11 bit code; the first bit will represent the type of bit that makes up the run, and the next 10 bits will represent the length of the run. I will then write out these bits iteratively in my expand function. I ran my first attempt, and am currently getting an expanded file that's even smaller than my compressed file. |

After a lot of debugging and help from Mr. Blick, I was able to finally get past this error, however now my compressed file is only 24 bits and my expanded file is 1000 bits, meaning that my compressed file is only representing one run of bits of the same type. This means that my next step will be to debug my compression file. |
| Nov 15 |  3:45pm-4:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I have continued to try to figure out how to debug my compression method, however I haven't made much progress. I understand that I am only writing out a header and a code representing one run, but I don't understand why this is happening. Maybe the length of the sequence my for loop is using is incorrect? |
| Nov 15 |   7pm-7:30pm    | I went for a walk and while I was walking I thought of a reason that my code might not be working; when I read in the sequence of bits, I call readString(), which is actually reading in 8 bit characters as opposed to the individual binary values. To fix this, I instead added the binary values one at a time to an empty string, and then kept the process the same from there. I actually got my code to work by doing this! I now have a 19% lossless compression for the largest case, a 55% compression for the medium case, and I actually have a slight expansion for the smallest case. |
| Nov 16 | 10:30am-10:45am |                                                                                                                           I realized that it was inefficient to hold the binary sequence in a String in my compression method, because I had to convert the booleans to chars, and then convert those chars back to booleans. I thought for a bit and realized that it would be much more efficient to just store all of the bits in a Queue, that way I wouldn't have to go back and forth between the data types. I made this alteration fairly quickly and my code now works with a Queue instead. |
| Nov 19 |  11:30am-12pm   |                                                                                                                                                        I realized that because the bit type of each sequence was going to switch every run, I didn't have to write out the bit type of every run. Instead, I only had to write the type of bit of the first run, and then I could alternate the type of bit that I was writing for each run in my expansion method. I was actually able to make this alteration fairly quickly, and I decreased my compression ratio from 19.3% to 17.7% as a result. |
